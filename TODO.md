- Add some sort of StatisticsManager class that will have methods for easy processing of events.
- Add Async Timer to save data on sql every x minutes to prevent large loss of data through crashes.
- Start implementing events and storing the data.
- Add more options for customizing in the config.yml
- After some implementations test the plugin to see if storage works without flaws or loss of data
